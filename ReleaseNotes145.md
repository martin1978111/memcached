## Overview ##

This is a maintenance release with some build fixes, doc fixes, and
one new stat.


## Fixes ##

  * Properly detect CPU alignment on ARM. [bug100](https://code.google.com/p/memcached/issues/detail?id=0)
  * Remove 1MB assertion. [bug 119](https://code.google.com/p/memcached/issues/detail?id=19)
  * More automake versions supported.
  * Compiler warning fixes for OpenBSD.
  * potential buffer overflow in vperror
  * Report errors opening pidfiles using vperror


## New Features ##


### New stat: reclaimed ###
This stat reports the number of times an entry was stored using memory
from an expired entry.


### sasl\_pwdb for more simple auth deployments ###

--enable-sasl-pwdb allows memcached to use it's own password file and
verify a plaintext password.

The file is specified with the environment variable
MEMCACHED\_SASL\_PWDB, and is a plain text file with the following
syntax:

```
username:password
```

Please note that you have to specify "mech\_list: plain" in your sasl
config file for this to work.

Ex:

```
   echo "mech_list: plain" > memcached.conf
   echo "myname:mypass" > /tmp/memcached-sasl-db
   export MEMCACHED_SASL_PWDB=/tmp/memcached-sasl-db
   export SASL_CONF_PATH=`pwd`/memcached.conf
   ./memcached -S -v
```

and you should be able to use your favorite memcached client with sasl
support to connect to the server.

(Please note that not all SASL implementations support
SASL\_CB\_GETCONF, so you may have to install the sasl config
(memcached.conf) to the systemwide location)
