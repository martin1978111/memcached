#summary Speaking Memcached

Memcached fosters an active mailing list and friendly IRC channel. Developers and users attend many technical conferences as well. If you're having trouble, odds are good the mailing list archives, or contacting the mailing list, will be a step in the right direction. Many smart people from many web companies chill out with us.

If you wish to partake in the fun, please remember to be courteous and professional. We should aim to help people accomplish great things, and in doing so learn more ourselves. Remember that these channels are about the **open source project**, memcached. We're thankful for your commerical support and amazing products, but please keep advertising outside.

# Wiki Contributions #

Want to contribute to the wiki? Be our guest!

The easiest way to get a change through is to e-mail a patch or phrase or page idea to the mailing list. Many wiki editors are active over there.

If you would like to edit it yourself, or continue to make contributions more easily, simply ask the mailing list for wiki access. Restrictions are purely to avoid spam, and not to keep people from helping.

Seriously, it's easy. We like documentation. Help out!
