# Release Notes for 1.2.8 #

There were no release notes for 1.2.8, as it was a quick turnaround fix for an issue that had come up after 1.2.7.

From the email announcement about 1.2.8:

A few bugs were fixed that warranted an immediate release of memcached  1.2.8. If you are running memcached prior to 1.2.7, please skip 1.2.7 and  upgrade straight to 1.2.8.
**Please note** that the critical bug noted below only affects memcached  binaries built with --enable-threads. While highly recommended, this is  not the default in the 1.2 series. It is the default in 1.3.
