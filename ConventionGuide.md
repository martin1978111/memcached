# TENTATIVE NOTES #

[From the Advocacy page](Advocacy.md)

**If you are staffing the booth**

If you are staffing the booth please wear unbranded, or memcached-branded clothing.

**If you want to have marketing material at the booth**

Having a well organized and inclusive booth is important to the memcached community. Our booths have helped many people answer questions, and sometimes given out fun materials.

Only contributors are allowed within the memcached portfolio. If you are not a contributor there are a number of ways to become a contributor:

```
  * Help review documentation and submit patches
  * Sponsor development
  * Participate actively in the lists
```

```
* We welcome and invite all contributors to submit material to be presented
  to potential booth visitors.
* Material presented at the booths will be memcached and memcached
  contributors only.
* Material should be constructive, showing off the strengths and new abilities
  of memcached. Advocacy in the form of commercial alternatives or commercial
  support at the cost of the project are to be strictly avoided. 
```

The material provided by contributors will be presented via a memcached "portfolio". Essentially a folder. The folder will be memcached branded, full color and very attractive. The requirement for submission to the folder is:

  * (1) 8.5x11, full color is fine, duplex is fine.
